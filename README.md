## Description
This is a book search engine application built with the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. It allows users to search for books, view detailed information about them, and save their favorite books to a personal reading list.

The application initially used a RESTful API to fetch book data from the Google Books API. However, it has been refactored to use a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server, providing a more efficient and flexible way to fetch and modify data.
